            <h3 class="gallery-label">Bookmarks Web Application Case Study</h3>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Project Problems & Hypothesis</h4>
            <P>
                The objective of this project was to develop a fully functional prototype of a bookmark manager
                application using PHP. Collaborating in teams of three, we designed and built the application from the
                ground up as part of our final project. Our approach prioritized creating a user-friendly interface,
                operating under the hypothesis that simplicity in design—minimizing user input and actions—would enhance
                the overall user experience.
            </P>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">My Role in the Project</h4>
            <p>
                For this project, we worked in groups of three. While one of my teammates contributed by sharing his
                vision for the web application's appearance and provided a wireframe, I took on the role of sole
                designer. I was responsible for creating all prototypes and translating the design into the functional
                web application.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Proposed Solutions</h4>
            <p>
                Our proposed solution focused on developing a simple interface featuring large buttons and
                contrasting colors to ensure users could easily identify the purpose and function of each element.
                Additionally, we aimed to streamline the user experience by minimizing the number of pages required to
                perform key actions, such as adding, deleting, modifying, pinning bookmarks, or logging out.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">How the Solution Solved our Problem</h4>
            <p>
                Our solution effectively addressed the problem by delivering a fully functional web application with a
                straightforward user interface, meeting the expectations of our stakeholder, our
                professor. The application enables users to seamlessly add, modify, delete, pin, and access both new and
                existing bookmarks.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Challenges We Faced</h4>
            <p>
                Some challenges I encountered during this project included working with PHP in a project environment for
                the first time, utilizing Git to push changes to a GitHub repository, and using a remote server, such as
                FileZilla, for project development. These were all new experiences for me, and I faced difficulties
                initially due to my limited prior exposure to these tools and processes.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">How the Project affects Users</h4>
            <p>
                This project was highly beneficial to users due to its simple and intuitive design. It provides easy
                access to saved bookmarks while enabling seamless actions such as adding, removing, modifying, and
                pinning bookmarks which are all accessible within a single page for enhanced convenience.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">What I learned</h4>
            <p>
                During this project, I gained hands-on experience with PHP, Git, and FileZilla. Working in a
                collaborative, workplace-simulated environment allowed me to strengthen my skills while applying Agile
                methodology. Overall, this project provided valuable experience in a programming environment, enhancing
                my technical skills such as coding in PHP and managing version control by pushing changes to a Git
                repository.
