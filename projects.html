        <h2>Zwift Redesign</h2>
        <p class="date">11/24/2023</p>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This class project focused on redesigning the Zwift Companion app to help users easily find their personal
            bests, view past rides, explore worlds, and track specific metrics to improve their biking performance.
            While designing new pages, we worked to maintain the app's existing design language and incorporated
            additional tabs to enhance usability. These new tabs were intended to allow users to access their past rides
            and personal bests more efficiently, improving the overall user experience.

        <h2>Sleeper Compare Addition</h2>
        <p class="date">4/8/2024</p>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This was a class project that involved working independently to redesign an app by adding a new feature. I
            chose to
            implement a comparison tool within the fantasy football app, Sleeper. Many users often compare players
            before games or trades, but the app currently lacks this functionality, forcing users to rely on external
            websites for comparisons. The objective of this project was to address this gap by creating a positional
            comparison tool, allowing users to compare players directly within the app.

        <h2>Bookmark Web application</h2>
        <p class="date">4/8/2024</p>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This was another class project where we worked in teams of three to create a functional web application that
            allows users to save bookmarks of URLs. I was the sole UX designer for the project, though my team advocated
            for a purple and yellow color scheme to align with UWSPâ€™s branding. The design was focused on minimizing the
            time users spend searching for and adding bookmarks. To achieve this, I created large, easily identifiable
            buttons to enhance user interaction and streamline the overall experience.
