            <h4 class="gallery-label">Project Problems & Hypothesis</h4>
            <P>
                Sleeper is a fantasy football app that has been growing in popularity, but unlike many other fantasy
                football platforms, it lacks a player comparison tool. This has led to frustration among users who need
                to leave the app or website to compare player stats. I hypothesized that by implementing a player
                comparison tool within the app, users would be able to easily compare players without leaving the
                platform, ultimately increasing user engagement and the amount of time spent on the app.
            </P>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">My Role in the Project</h4>
            <p>
                I was the sole designer on this project, tasked with creating a new feature for the Sleeper app. I was
                solely responsible for all design artifacts, ensuring that the new feature aligned with the app's
                existing design language and overall user experience.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Proposed Solutions</h4>
            <p>
                The proposed solution involved utilizing the tabs within the player profiles. I removed the 'Teams' tab,
                which was less useful for users, and replaced it with a 'Compare' tab. This change allows users to
                easily click on the 'Compare' tab, where the current player is automatically populated on the left side.
                Users can then select another player of the same position or choose a different player to compare by
                swapping them into the left column. This streamlined the comparison process and improved the overall
                user experience.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">How the Solution Solved our Problem</h4>
            <p>
                This solution effectively addressed the issue by implementing a comparison tool directly within the
                player profiles. The tool enables users to compare any players of the same position without the need for
                adding additional tabs to the app. This approach maintains a clean and uncluttered interface while
                providing users with more freedom to explore player comparisons easily.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Challenges We Faced</h4>
            <p>
                A challenge I faced in this project was determining the best location to implement the comparison tool.
                Given the complexity of the Sleeper app, with its many tabs and options, it was important to place the
                tool in a location where users frequently access player stats. I decided to incorporate the comparison
                tool within the player profile, as this is a commonly visited area. This ensures that users who want to
                compare player stats will easily find the tool without adding unnecessary clutter to the interface.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">How the Project affects Sleeper</h4>
            <p>
                While this project does not directly impact Sleeper, as it is a school project, it would be highly
                beneficial to the platform. The new feature would enable users to quickly and efficiently compare player
                stats, an option that is currently missing from both their app and website. By integrating this
                functionality, users would be able to stay within the app for comparison purposes, leading to increased
                user engagement and more frequent use of the Sleeper app.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">What I learned</h4>
            <p>
                During this project, I learned the importance of understanding what your target audience is looking for
                and how they interpret the information. One key lesson came from my professorâ€™s suggestion to avoid
                using abbreviations between stats. However, I chose to keep them in this case because they were already
                used consistently throughout other parts of the app, making it relevant for users who are familiar with
                the abbreviations. This experience reinforced the need to balance clarity with consistency in design.
