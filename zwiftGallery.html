            <h3>Zwift Companion Case Study</h3>
            <h4>Project Problems & Hypothesis</h4>
            <P>
                The Zwift Companion app was small group class project due to Zwift making it difficult for users to
                navigate
                to view personal bests, past rides, worlds, and ride metrics. We hypothesized that this would be
                important
                for
                users to easilly navigate to and view the information of their rides. Our goal was to streamline the
                user
                flow to
                make finding ride information much easier than it currently was.
            </P>
            <h4>My Role in the Project</h4>
            <p>
                I was one of 3 UX designers in the group, we worked together to find potential solutions which would
                stay
                inline
                with Zwifts current design. We were all equally responsible for creating deliverables such as a new
                journey,
                design artifacts, and documentation of why we believed our solution would work.
            </p>
            <h4>Proposed Solutions</h4>
            <p>
                To find our proposed solution we each downloaded the Zwift Companion app and began to look for data on
                previous worlds, rides, personal bests, and ride metrics. What we found was it was very difficult to
                find
                these in any way at all. We believed that implementing new pages within the 'more' tab on the bottom
                left
                was our best option.
            </p>
            <h4>How the Solution Solved our Problem</h4>
            <p>
                Our proposed solution solves the problem by directly implementing new screens which will be easilly
                found
                within
                the 'more' tab in the navigation bar. This will allow users to be just a few clicks away from finding
                any
                metric
                that is collected by Zwift.
            </p>
            <h4>Challenges We Faced</h4>
            <p>
                Some problems we initially faced were trying to find the Zwift design system so we could keep our design
                inline with the current application. Eventually we were able to find the color palette and typography
                needed
                to
                move forward with our project and begin prototyping.
            </p>
            <h4>How the Project affects Zwift</h4>
            <p>
                This project doesn not directly affect wift due to it being a school project. This project however,
                would be
                beneficial
                to Zwift as it allows the user easy access to view important information and data. If implemented into
                the
                Zwift app
                there would be an easy path to find this hidden data and allow for a better user experience and user
                journey
                to find the
                desired data.
            </p>
            <h4>What I learned</h4>
            <p>
                Because of this project I learned how important it was to put myself in the shoes of a user when
                creating
                user journeys. Throughout this project we had to look at it from a user's point of view and understand
                that
                they do not understand how we intend for them to use the product. It is extremely important as a
                designer
                and a
                developer that we think as if the user is viewing the product for the first time and they are unsure of
                how
                the product is intended to be used and navigated.
