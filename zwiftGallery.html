            <h3 class="gallery-label">Zwift Companion Case Study</h3>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Project Problems & Hypothesis</h4>
            <P>
                The Zwift Companion app was a small-group class project designed to address the challenges users faced
                when navigating Zwift to access personal bests, past rides, worlds, and ride metrics. We hypothesized
                that providing users with an easier way to locate and view this information would greatly enhance their
                experience. Our goal was to streamline the user flow, simplifying the process of finding and interacting
                with ride data compared to the existing system.
            </P>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">My Role in the Project</h4>
            <p>
                As one of three UX designers in the group, I collaborated closely with my teammates to identify
                potential solutions that aligned with Zwift's existing design. Together, we shared equal
                responsibility for creating key deliverables, including a reimagined user journey, design artifacts, and
                detailed documentation explaining the rationale behind our proposed solution.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Proposed Solutions</h4>
            <p>
                To develop our proposed solution, each team member downloaded the Zwift Companion app and conducted an
                exploration of its features to locate data on previous worlds, rides, personal bests, and ride
                metrics. We discovered that accessing this information was challenging and unreasonable. Based on our
                findings, we determined that adding new, dedicated pages within the "More" tab on the bottom left of the
                app would be the most effective solution to improve navigation and accessibility.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">How the Solution Solved our Problem</h4>
            <p>
                Our proposed solution addresses the problem by introducing new, easily accessible screens within the
                "More" tab in the navigation bar. This design ensures that users can quickly and effortlessly access any
                metrics collected by Zwift, reducing the number of clicks needed to find important data.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">Challenges We Faced</h4>
            <p>
                One of the initial challenges we faced was locating the Zwift design system, which was crucial for
                ensuring our design aligned with the existing application. After some effort, we were able to find the
                necessary color palette and typography, allowing us to proceed with the project and begin prototyping
                effectively.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">How the Project affects Zwift</h4>
            <p>
                While this project does not directly impact Zwift, as it is a school project, it would nonetheless be
                beneficial to the platform. The proposed solution would offer users easy access to important information
                and data, improving the overall experience. If implemented into the Zwift app, it would provide a
                straightforward path to access previously hidden data, enhancing the user journey and making it easier
                to find the desired metrics.
            </p>
            <h4 class="gallery-label">What I learned</h4>
            <p>
                Through this project, I learned the importance of putting myself in the shoes of the user when creating
                user journeys. We had to consistently view the project from the user's perspective, understanding that
                they don't know how we intend for them to interact with the product. As a designer and developer, it's
                crucial to approach the design process as though the user is encountering the product for the first
                time, unsure of how to navigate or use it. This mindset helps ensure that the product is intuitive and
                easy to use.
